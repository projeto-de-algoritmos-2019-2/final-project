An autocompleter can only suggest words that it knows about.
The suggested words come from a predefined vocabulary, for
example all distinct words in Wikipedia or in the Oxford
English Dictionary.

The heart of an autocompleter is a function that takes in the
beginning of a word, or a prefix, and searches for vocabulary
words that start with the given prefix.

Searches for vocabulary words implementations:

	-> A naive implementation would iterate sequentially over the
	vocabulary words checking each in turn to see if it starts
	with the given prefix.

	-> [Binary Search] A better implementation keeps the
	vocabulary words sorted  in alphabetical order. Searching for
	a prefix in an ordered  vocabulary is pretty fast with the
	help of a binary search algorithm.

	-> [Prefix tree - TRie] Typically many vocabulary words begin with
	the same prefix (broccoli, broker, brother and many other
	words all start with bro-). It seems wasteful to have to
	store the common prefix separately for each word.

	-> [Minimizing a prefix tree DFA] Handle shared word parts
	efficiently

	-> [Most valuable completions first] This can be achieved by
	including an integer weight, which represents the value of a
	word, for each word in the vocabulary, and by showing the
	completions with the highest weight first.

	-> [Tolerate small spelling errors] Following not only the
	exact path defined by a given prefix but also some neighboring
	paths with minor spelling variations.

	-> [Add user words] Modifying the full data structure might
	be too expensive, however. A solution is to keep two data
	structures: one with a fixed global vocabulary and another
	with that user's words. The latter is much smaller and
	therefore faster to update.

	-> [Phrases] The search string is broken into tokens
	determined by whitespace (each non-whitespace "word" is a
	token)


## Ideas
	- Phrase suggestion
	- Word Correction
	- Next Word prediction
	- Phonetic Algorithms [Index words by sound]

## Algorithms
	- Word-partials (ngrams, Pattern Partitioning)
	- Phrase-terms (shingles)
	- Word-proximity (word-clustering-index)
	- Ternary-search-tree (word lookup)
	- Trees (prefix tree, suffix tree, dawg)
	- Soundex (sounds familiar)
	- Levenshtein distance (Steps to reach another word)
	- BK Trees (finding near-matches)
	- Markov Chain (predict next word based on previous words)
